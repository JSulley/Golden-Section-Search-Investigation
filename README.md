# Golden-Section-Search-Investigation 
This was part of an assignment for my Computational Mathematics course in graduate school that I personally enjoyed. It revolves around the Golden Section Search Algorithm which is a numerical approach to optimizing a function within an interval.
Python was the primary language with the use of the NumPy library along with the Matplotlib module PyLab.
