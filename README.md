# Golden-Section-Search-Investigation 
This was part of an assignment for my Computational Mathematics course in graduate school that I personally enjoyed. It revolves around the Golden Section Search Algorithm which is a numerical approach to optimizing a function within an interval. I extended the second part with more math because it was amazing to see how it turned out.

The code was written in Python and the NumPy library was used along with the Matplotlib module PyLab.
